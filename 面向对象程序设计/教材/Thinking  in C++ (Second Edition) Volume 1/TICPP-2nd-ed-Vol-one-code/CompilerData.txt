# Please note: the end user does not need to use this
# file or the ExtractCode program; simply download
# the zipped source-code file from www.MindView.net,
# unzip it and type "make" at the command-line. See
# Chapter 3 of Volume 1 for details about using 'make'.
#################################################
# This file contains the compiler information database 
# which is used by the automatic code extraction 
# program ExtractCode.cpp (in Volume 2 of this 
# book) to build makefiles that will work properly 
# with the various compilers. It is included here
# for your information.
#
# This file is used by ExtractCode.cpp to generate 
# the makefiles for the book, including the command-
# line flags for each vendor's compiler and 
# linker. Following that are the code listings 
# from the book that will not compile for each 
# compiler. The listings are, to the best of my 
# knowledge, correct Standard C++ (According to 
# the ISO Standard). Please note that the tests 
# were performed with the most recent compiler 
# that I had at the time, and may have changed 
# since this file was created.

# Compiling all files, for a (theoretical) fully-
# conformant compiler. This assumes a typical
# compiler under dos:
{ all }
# Object file name extension in parentheses:
(obj)
# Executable file extension in square brackets:
[exe]
# The leading '&' is for special directives. The
# dos directive means to replace '/' 
# with '\' in all directory paths:
&dos
# The following lines will be inserted directly
# into the makefile (sans the leading '@' sign)
# If your environment variables are set to 
# establish these you won't need to use arguments
# on the make command line to set them:
# CPP: the name of your C++ compiler
# CPPFLAGS: Compilation flags for your compiler
# OFLAG: flag to give the final executable name
#@CPP = yourcompiler
#@CPPFLAGS =
#@OFLAG = -e
@.SUFFIXES : .obj .cpp .c
@.cpp.obj :
@   $(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $<
@.c.obj :
@   $(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $<
# Assumes all files will compile
# See later for an example of Unix configuration

# Visual C++ 6.0 –- With Service Pack 3!!!
# Target name used in makefile:

# The leading '&' is for special directives. The

# Inserted directly into the makefile (without
# the leading '@' sign):
@# Note: this requires the service Pack 3 from 
@# www.Microsoft.com for successful compilation!
@# Also, you cannot run the "test" makefiles
@# unless you go through and put 'return 0;' at
@# the end of every main(), because VC++ does not
@# follow the C++ Standard for defaulting return
@# values from main().
