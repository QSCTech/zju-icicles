<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4>This chapter will introduce enough
C++ syntax and program construction concepts to allow you to write
</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4>and run some simple object-oriented
programs. In the subsequent chapter we will cover the basic syntax of C and C++
in detail.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">By reading this chapter first,
you&#8217;ll get the basic flavor of what it is like to program with objects in
C++, and you&#8217;ll also discover some of the reasons for the enthusiasm
surrounding this language. This should be enough to carry you through Chapter 3,
which can be a bit exhausting since it contains most of the details of the C
language.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The user-defined data
type<A NAME="Index253"></A><A NAME="Index254"></A>, or
<I>class<A NAME="Index255"></A></I>, is what distinguishes C++ from traditional
procedural languages. A class is a new data type that you or someone else
creates to solve a particular kind of problem. Once a class is created, anyone
can use it without knowing the specifics of how it works, or even how classes
are built. This chapter treats classes as if they are just another built-in data
type available for use in programs. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Classes that someone else has created are
typically packaged into a library<A NAME="Index256"></A>. This chapter uses
several of the class libraries that come with all C++ implementations. An
especially important standard library is iostreams, which (among other things)
allow you to read from files and the keyboard, and to write to files and the
display. You&#8217;ll also see the very handy <B>string </B>class, and the
<B>vector </B>container from the Standard C++ Library. By the end of the
chapter, you&#8217;ll see how easy it is to use a pre-defined library of
classes.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In order to create your first program you
must understand the tools used to build

The process of language translation</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">All computer languages are translated
from something that tends to be easy for a human to understand (<I>source
code</I>)<I> </I>into something that is executed on a computer (<I>machine
instructions<A NAME="Index257"></A></I>). Traditionally, translators fall into
two classes: <I>interpreters</I> and
<A NAME="Index258"></A><I>compilers</I>.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc462979714"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654718"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading67"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Interpreters<A NAME="Index259"></A></H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">An interpreter translates source code
into activities (which may comprise groups of machine instructions) and
immediately executes those activities. <A NAME="Index260"></A>BASIC, for
example, has been a popular interpreted language. Traditional BASIC interpreters
translate and execute one line at a time, and then forget that the line has been
translated. This makes them slow, since they must re-translate any repeated
code. BASIC has also been compiled, for speed. More modern interpreters, such as
those for the <A NAME="Index261"></A>Python language, translate the entire
program into an intermediate language that is then executed by a much faster
interpreter</FONT><A NAME="fnB25" HREF="#fn25">[25]</A><A NAME="Index262"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Interpreters have many advantages. The
transition from writing code to executing code is almost immediate, and the
source code is always available so the interpreter can be much more specific
when an error occurs. The benefits often cited for interpreters are ease of
interaction and rapid development (but not necessarily execution) of
programs.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Interpreted languages often have severe
limitations when building large projects (Python seems to be an exception to
this). The interpreter (or a reduced version) must always be in memory to
execute the code, and even the fastest interpreter may introduce unacceptable
speed restrictions. Most interpreters require that the complete source code be
brought into the interpreter all at once. Not only does this introduce a space
limitation, it can also cause more difficult bugs if the language doesn&#8217;t
provide facilities to localize the effect of different pieces of
code.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc462979715"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654719"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading68"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Compilers<A NAME="Index263"></A></H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A compiler translates source code
directly into assembly language or machine instructions. The eventual end
product is a file or files containing machine code. This is an involved process,
and usually takes several steps. The transition from writing code to executing
code is significantly longer with a compiler.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Depending on the acumen of the compiler
writer, programs generated by a compiler tend to require much less space to run,
and they run much more quickly. Although size and speed are probably the most
often cited reasons for using a compiler, in many situations they aren&#8217;t
the most important reasons. Some languages (such as C) are designed to allow
pieces of a program to be compiled independently. These pieces are eventually
combined into a final <I>executable</I> program by a tool called the
<I>linker<A NAME="Index264"></A></I>. This process is called <I>separate
compilation<A NAME="Index265"></A><A NAME="Index266"></A></I>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Separate compilation has many benefits. A
program that, taken all at once, would exceed the limits of the compiler or the
compiling environment can be compiled in pieces. Programs can be built and
tested one piece at a time. Once a piece is working, it can be saved and treated
as a building block. Collections of tested and working pieces can be combined
into <A NAME="Index267"></A><I>libraries</I> for use by other programmers. As
each piece is created, the complexity of the other pieces is hidden. All these
features support the creation of large
programs</FONT><A NAME="fnB26" HREF="#fn26">[26]</A><A NAME="Index268"></A><A NAME="Index269"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Compiler debugging<A NAME="Index270"></A>
features have improved significantly over time. Early compilers only generated
machine code, and the programmer inserted print statements to see what was going
on. This is not always effective. Modern compilers can insert information about
the source code into the executable program. This information is used by
powerful <A NAME="Index271"></A><I>source-level debuggers</I> to show exactly
what is happening in a program by tracing its progress through the source
code.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Some compilers tackle the
compilation-speed problem by performing <A NAME="Index272"></A><I>in-memory
compilation</I>. Most compilers work with files, reading and writing them in
each step of the compilation process. In-memory compilers keep the compiler
program in RAM. For small programs, this can seem as responsive as an
interpreter.

<A NAME="Heading69"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
The compilation process<A NAME="Index273"></A></H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">To program in C and C++, you need to
understand the steps and tools in the compilation process. Some languages (C and
C++, in particular) start compilation by running a
<I>preprocessor<A NAME="Index274"></A></I> on the source code. The preprocessor
is a simple program that replaces patterns in the source code with other
patterns the programmer has defined (using <I>preprocessor
directives<A NAME="Index275"></A></I>). Preprocessor directives are used to save
typing and to increase the readability of the code. (Later in the book,
you&#8217;ll learn how the design of C++ is meant to discourage much of the use
of the preprocessor, since it can cause subtle bugs.) The pre-processed code is
often written to an intermediate file.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Compilers usually do their work in two
passes. The first pass <I>parses<A NAME="Index276"></A></I> the pre-processed
code. The compiler breaks the source code into small units and organizes it into
a structure called a <I>tree<A NAME="Index277"></A></I>. In the expression
&#8220;<B>A + B</B>&#8221; the elements &#8216;<B>A</B>&#8217;,
&#8216;<B>+,</B>&#8217; and &#8216;<B>B</B>&#8217; are leaves on the parse
tree.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A <I>global
optimizer<A NAME="Index278"></A></I> is sometimes used between the first and
second passes to produce smaller, faster code.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In the second pass, the <I>code
generator<A NAME="Index279"></A></I> walks through the parse tree and generates
either assembly language code or machine code for the nodes of the tree. If the
code generator creates assembly code, the assembler must then be run. The end
result in both cases is an object module<A NAME="Index280"></A> (a file that
typically has an extension of <B>.o</B> or <B>.obj</B>). A <I>peephole
optimizer<A NAME="Index281"></A></I> is sometimes used in the second pass to
look for pieces of code containing redundant assembly-language
statements.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The use of the word
&#8220;object&#8221;<A NAME="Index282"></A> to describe chunks of machine code
is an unfortunate artifact. The word came into use before object-oriented
programming was in general use. &#8220;Object&#8221; is used in the same sense
as &#8220;goal&#8221; when discussing compilation, while in object-oriented
programming it means &#8220;a thing with boundaries.&#8221;</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The <I>linker<A NAME="Index283"></A></I>
combines a list of object modules into an executable program that can be loaded
and run by the operating system. When a function in one object module makes a
reference to a function or variable in another object module, the linker
resolves these references; it makes sure that all the external functions and
data you claimed existed during compilation do exist<A NAME="Index284"></A>. The
linker also adds a special object module to perform start-up
activities.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The linker can search through special
files called <I>libraries</I> in order to resolve all its references. A
library<A NAME="Index285"></A> contains a collection of object modules in a
single file. A library is created and maintained by a program called a
<I>librarian</I>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading70"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H4 ALIGN="LEFT">
Static type checking<BR><A NAME="Index286"></A></H4></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The compiler performs <I>type
checking<A NAME="Index287"></A></I> during the first pass. Type checking tests
for the proper use of arguments in functions and prevents many kinds of
programming errors. Since type checking occurs during compilation instead of
when the program is running, it is called <I>static type checking</I>.
</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Some object-oriented languages (notably
Java<A NAME="Index288"></A>) perform some type checking at runtime (<I>dynamic
type checking</I>). If combined with static type checking,
<A NAME="Index289"></A>dynamic type checking is more powerful than static type
checking alone. However, it also adds overhead to program
execution.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">C++ uses static type checking because the
language cannot assume any particular runtime support for bad operations. Static
type checking notifies the programmer about misuses of types during compilation,
and thus maximizes execution speed. As you learn C++, you will see that most of
the language design decisions favor the same kind of high-speed,
production-oriented programming the C language is famous for.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You can disable static type checking in
C++. You can also do your own dynamic type checking &#8211; you just need to
write the code.

<A NAME="Heading71"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Tools for separate compilation</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Separate compilation is particularly
important <A NAME="Index290"></A>when building large projects. In C and C++, a
program can be created in small, manageable, independently tested pieces. The
most fundamental tool for breaking a program up into pieces is the ability to
create named subroutines or subprograms. In C and C++, a subprogram is called a
<A NAME="Index291"></A><I>function</I>, and functions are the pieces of code
that can be placed in different files, enabling separate compilation. Put
another way, the function is the atomic unit of code, since you cannot have part
of a function in one file and another part in a different file; the entire
function must be placed in a single file (although files can and do contain more
than one function).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">When you call a function, you typically
pass it some <I>arguments</I>, which are values you&#8217;d like the function to
work with during its execution. When the function is finished, you typically get
back a <A NAME="Index292"></A><A NAME="Index293"></A><I>return value</I>, a
value that the function hands back to you as a result. It&#8217;s also possible
to write functions that take no <A NAME="Index294"></A>arguments and return no
values.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">To create a program with multiple files,
functions in one file must access functions and data in other files. When
compiling a file, the C or C++ compiler must know about the functions and data
in the other files, in particular their names and proper usage. The compiler
ensures that functions and data are used correctly. This process of
&#8220;telling the compiler&#8221; the names of external functions and data and
what they should look like is called <I>declaration<A NAME="Index295"></A></I>.
Once you declare a function or variable, the compiler knows how to check to make
sure it is used
properly.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373820"></A><A NAME="_Toc462979718"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654722"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading72"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Declarations vs. definitions</H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">It&#8217;s important to understand the
difference between <I>declarations<A NAME="Index296"></A></I> and
<I>definitions<A NAME="Index297"></A></I> because these terms will be used
precisely throughout the book. Essentially all C and C++ programs require
declarations. Before you can write your first program, you need to understand
the proper way to write a declaration.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A <I>declaration</I> introduces a name
&#8211; an identifier &#8211; to the compiler. It tells the compiler &#8220;This
function or this variable exists somewhere, and here is what it should look
like.&#8221; A <I>definition</I>, on the other hand, says: &#8220;Make this
variable here&#8221; or &#8220;Make this function here.&#8221; It allocates
storage for the name. This meaning works whether you&#8217;re talking about a
variable or a function; in either case, at the point of definition the compiler
allocates storage. For a variable, the compiler determines how big that variable
is and causes space to be generated in memory to hold the data for that
variable. For a function, the compiler generates code, which ends up occupying
storage in memory. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You can declare a variable or a function
in many different places, but there must be only one definition in C and C++
(this is sometimes called the ODR: <A NAME="Index298"></A><I>one-definition
rule</I>). When the linker is uniting all the object modules, it will usually
complain if it finds more than one definition for the same function or
variable.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A definition can also be a declaration.
If the compiler hasn&#8217;t seen the name <B>x</B> before and you define <B>int
x;</B>, the compiler sees the name as a declaration and allocates storage for it
all at once.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading73"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H4 ALIGN="LEFT">
Function declaration
syntax<BR><A NAME="Index299"></A><A NAME="Index300"></A><A NAME="Index301"></A></H4></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A function declaration in C and C++ gives
the function name, the argument types passed to the function, and the return
value of the function. For example, here is a declaration for a function called
<B>func1(&#160;) </B>that takes two integer arguments (integers are denoted in
C/C++ with the keyword <B>int</B>) and returns an integer:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>int</font> func1(<font color=#0000ff>int</font>,<font color=#0000ff>int</font>);</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The first keyword you see is the return
value all by itself: <B>int</B>. The arguments are enclosed in parentheses after
the function name in the order they are used. The semicolon indicates the end of
a statement; in this case, it tells the compiler &#8220;that&#8217;s all &#8211;
there is no function definition here!&#8221; </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">C and C++ declarations attempt to mimic
the form of the item&#8217;s use. For example, if <B>a</B> is another integer
the above function might be used this way:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE>a = func1(2,3);</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Since <B>func1</B>(&#160;) returns an
integer, the C or C++ compiler will check the use of <B>func1(&#160;)</B> to
make sure that <B>a</B> can accept the return value and that the arguments are
appropriate.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Arguments <A NAME="Index302"></A>in
function declarations may have names. The compiler ignores the names but they
can be helpful as mnemonic devices for the user. For example, we can declare
<B>func1(&#160;)</B> in a different fashion that has the same
meaning:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>int</font> func1(<font color=#0000ff>int</font> length, <font color=#0000ff>int</font> width);</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Heading74"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H4 ALIGN="LEFT">
A gotcha</H4></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">There is a significant difference between
C and C++ for functions with empty argument lists. In C, the
declaration:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>int</font> func2();</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">means &#8220;a function with any number
and type of argument.&#8221; This prevents type-checking<A NAME="Index303"></A>,
so in C++ it means &#8220;a function with no arguments.&#8221;</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading75"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H4 ALIGN="LEFT">
Function definitions<BR><A NAME="Index304"></A><A NAME="Index305"></A></H4></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Function definitions look like function
declarations except that they have bodies<A NAME="Index306"></A>. A body is a
collection of statements enclosed in braces. Braces denote the beginning and
ending of a block of code. To give <B>func1(&#160;)</B> a definition that is an
empty body (a body containing no code), write:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>int</font> func1(<font color=#0000ff>int</font> length, <font color=#0000ff>int</font> width) { }</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Notice that in the function definition,
the braces replace the semicolon. Since braces surround a statement or group of
statements, you don&#8217;t need a semicolon. Notice also that the arguments in
the function definition must have names if you want to use the arguments in the
function body (since they are never used here, they are
optional).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

Variable declaration syntax</H4></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The meaning attributed to the phrase
&#8220;variable declaration&#8221; has historically been confusing and
contradictory, and it&#8217;s important that you understand the correct
definition so you can read code properly. A variable declaration tells the
compiler what a variable looks like. It says, &#8220;I know you haven&#8217;t
seen this name before, but I promise it exists someplace, and it&#8217;s a
variable of X type.&#8221; </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In a function declaration, you give a
type (the return value), the function name, the argument list, and a semicolon.
That&#8217;s enough for the compiler to figure out that it&#8217;s a declaration
and what the function should look like. By inference, a variable declaration
might be a type followed by a name. For example:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>int</font> a;</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">could declare the variable <B>a</B> as an
integer, using the logic above. Here&#8217;s the conflict: there is enough
information in the code above for the compiler to create space for an integer
called <B>a</B>, and that&#8217;s what happens. To resolve this dilemma, a
keyword was necessary for C and C++ to say &#8220;This is only a declaration;
it&#8217;s defined elsewhere.&#8221; The keyword is
<B>extern<A NAME="Index310"></A><A NAME="Index311"></A></B>. It can mean the
definition is <B>extern</B>al to the file, or that the definition occurs later
in the file.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Declaring a variable without defining it
means using the <B>extern</B> keyword before a description of the variable, like
this:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>extern</font> <font color=#0000ff>int</font> a;</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>extern</B> can also apply to function
declarations. For <B>func1(&#160;)</B>, it looks like this:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>extern</font> <font color=#0000ff>int</font> func1(<font color=#0000ff>int</font> length, <font color=#0000ff>int</font> width);</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This statement is equivalent to the
previous <B>func1(&#160;)</B> declarations. Since there is no function body, the
compiler must treat it as a function declaration rather than a function
definition. The <B>extern</B> keyword is thus superfluous and optional for
function declarations. It is probably unfortunate that the designers of C did
not require the use of <B>extern</B> for function declarations; it would have
been more consistent and less confusing (but would have required more typing,
which probably explains the decision).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

can do one of two things. If it has not already encountered the definition for
the function or variable, it adds the identifier to its list of
&#8220;unresolved
references<A NAME="Index323"></A><A NAME="Index324"></A>.&#8221; If the linker
has already encountered the definition, the reference is
resolved.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">If the linker cannot find the definition

Libraries have some sort of indexing so the linker doesn&#8217;t need to look
through all the object modules in the library &#8211; it just looks in the
index. When the linker finds a definition in a library, the entire object
module, not just the function definition, is linked into the executable program.
Note that the whole library isn&#8217;t linked, just the object module in the
library that contains the definition you want (otherwise programs would be
unnecessarily large). If you want to minimize executable program size, you might
consider putting a single function in each source code file when you build your
own libraries. This requires more
editing</FONT><A NAME="fnB27" HREF="#fn27">[27]</A><A NAME="Index326"></A><A NAME="Index327"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">,

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because the linker searches files in the
order you give them, you can pre-empt the use of a library function
<A NAME="Index328"></A>by inserting a file with your own function, using the
same function name, into the list before the library name appears. Since the
linker will resolve any references to this function by using your function
before it searches the library, your function is used instead of the library
function. Note that this can also be a bug, and the kind of thing C++ namespaces
prevent.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

functions on Unix (in particular, Linux) platforms, and often under DOS/Windows.
For example, if you&#8217;re using multithreading you are better off using the

&#8220;a general-purpose place to send output.&#8221; You will see other

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">As mentioned in Chapter 1, one of the
problems encountered in the C language is that you &#8220;run out of
names&#8221; for functions and identifiers when your programs reach a certain
size. Of course, you don&#8217;t really run out of names; it does, however,
become harder to think of new ones after awhile. More importantly, when a
program reaches a certain size it&#8217;s typically broken up into pieces, each
of which is built and maintained by a different person or group. Since C
effectively has a single arena where all the identifier and function names live,
this means that all the developers must be careful not to accidentally use the
same names in situations where they can conflict. This rapidly becomes tedious,
time-wasting, and, ultimately, expensive.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Standard C++ has a mechanism to prevent
this collision: the <B>namespace</B> keyword. Each set of C++ definitions in a
library or program is &#8220;wrapped&#8221; in a namespace, and if some other
definition has an identical name, but is in a different namespace, then there is
no collision.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Namespaces are a convenient and helpful
tool, but their presence means that you must be aware of them before you can
write any programs. If you simply include a header file and use some functions
or objects from that header, you&#8217;ll probably get strange-sounding errors
when you try to compile the program, to the effect that the compiler cannot find
any of the declarations for the items that you just included in the header file!
After you see this message a few times you&#8217;ll become familiar with its
meaning (which is &#8220;You included the header file but all the declarations
are within a namespace and you didn&#8217;t tell the compiler that you wanted to
use the declarations in that namespace&#8221;).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

<A NAME="Index342"></A><A NAME="Index343"></A><B>using</B>. All of the Standard
C++ libraries are wrapped in a single namespace, which is
<A NAME="Index344"></A><A NAME="Index345"></A><B>std</B> (for
&#8220;standard&#8221;). As this book uses the standard libraries almost

written.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Exposing all the elements from a

this (as you&#8217;ll learn later in the book). However, the <B>using</B>

name Alex Stepanov (who was working at Hewlett-Packard at the time) used when he
presented his library to the C++ Standards Committee at the meeting in San
Diego, California in Spring 1994. The name stuck, especially after HP decided to
make it available for public downloads. Meanwhile, the committee integrated it
into the Standard C++ Library, making a large number of changes. STL's
development continues at
<A NAME="Index393"></A><A NAME="Index394"></A><A NAME="Index395"></A>Silicon
Graphics (SGI; see <I>http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL</I>). The SGI STL
diverges from the Standard C++ Library on many subtle points. So although it's a
popular misconception, the C++ Standard does not &#8220;include&#8221; the STL.
It can be a bit confusing since the containers and algorithms in the Standard
C++ Library have the same root (and usually the same names) as the SGI STL. In
this book, I will say &#8220;The Standard C++ Library&#8221; or &#8220;The

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Even though the implementation of the
Standard C++ Library containers and algorithms uses some advanced concepts and
the full coverage takes two large chapters in Volume 2 of this book, this

that the most basic of the standard containers, the <B>vector</B>, is introduced
in this early chapter and used throughout the book. You&#8217;ll find that you
can do a tremendous amount just by using the basics of <B>vector</B> and not
worrying about the underlying implementation (again, an important goal of OOP).
Since you&#8217;ll learn much more about this and the other containers when you
reach the Standard Library chapters in Volume 2, it seems forgivable if the
programs that use <B>vector </B>in the early portion of the book aren&#8217;t
exactly what an experienced C++ programmer would do. You&#8217;ll find that in
most cases, the usage shown here is adequate.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The <B>vector</B> class is a
<A NAME="Index396"></A><I>template</I>, which means that it can be efficiently
applied to different types. That is, we can create a <B>vector</B> of
<B>shape</B>s, a <B>vector</B> of <B>cat</B>s, a <B>vector</B> of
<B>string</B>s, etc. Basically, with a template you can create a &#8220;class of
anything.&#8221; To tell the compiler what it is that the class will work with
(in this case, what the <B>vector</B> will hold), you put the name of the
desired type in &#8220;angle brackets,&#8221; which means &#8216;&lt;&#8217; and
&#8216;&gt;&#8217;. So a <B>vector</B> of <B>string</B> would be denoted
<B>vector&lt;string&gt;</B>. When you do this, you end up with a customized
vector that will hold only <B>string</B> objects, and you&#8217;ll get an error
message from the compiler if you try to put anything else into
it.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Since <B>vector </B>expresses the concept
of a &#8220;container,&#8221; there must be a way to put things into the
<A NAME="Index397"></A>container and get things back out of the container. To
add a brand-new element on the end of a <B>vector</B>, you use the member
function <A NAME="Index398"></A><A NAME="Index399"></A><B>push_back(&#160;).</B>
(Remember that, since it&#8217;s a member function, you use a
&#8216;<B>.</B>&#8217; to call it for a particular object.) The reason the name
of this member function might seem a bit verbose &#8211;
<B>push_back(&#160;)</B> instead of something simpler like &#8220;put&#8221;
&#8211; is because there are other containers and other member functions for
putting new elements into containers. For example, there is an
<A NAME="Index400"></A><A NAME="Index401"></A><B>insert(&#160;)</B> member
function to put something in the middle of a container. <B>vector</B> supports
this but its use is more complicated and we won&#8217;t need to explore it until
Volume 2 of the book. There&#8217;s also a
<A NAME="Index402"></A><B>push_front(&#160;)</B> (not part of <B>vector</B>) to
put things at the beginning. There are many more member functions in
<B>vector</B> and many more containers in the Standard C++ Library, but
you&#8217;ll be surprised at how much you can do just knowing about a few simple
features.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">So you can put new elements into a
<B>vector</B> with <B>push_back(&#160;)</B>, but how do you get these elements
back out again? This solution is more clever and elegant &#8211; operator
overloading is used to make the <B>vector</B> look like an <I>array</I>. The
array (which will be described more fully in the next chapter) is a data type
that is available in virtually every programming language so you should already
be somewhat familiar with it. Arrays are
<A NAME="Index403"></A><I>aggregates</I>, which mean they consist of a number of
elements clumped together. The distinguishing characteristic of an array is that
these elements are the same size and are arranged to be one right after the
other. Most importantly, these elements can be selected by
&#8220;indexing,&#8221; which means you can say &#8220;I want element number
n&#8221; and that element will be produced, usually quickly. Although there are
exceptions in programming languages, the indexing is normally achieved using
square brackets, so if you have an array <B>a</B> and you want to produce
element five, you say <B>a[4] </B>(note that
<A NAME="Index404"></A><A NAME="Index405"></A>indexing always starts at
zero).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This very compact and powerful indexing
notation is incorporated into the <B>vector</B> using operator overloading, just
like &#8216;<B>&lt;&lt;</B>&#8217; and &#8216;<B>&gt;&gt;</B>&#8217; were
incorporated into iostreams. Again, you don&#8217;t need to know how the
overloading was implemented &#8211; that&#8217;s saved for a later chapter
&#8211; but it&#8217;s helpful if you&#8217;re aware that there&#8217;s some
magic going on under the covers in order to make the <B>[&#160;]</B> work with
<B>vector</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">With that in mind, you can now see a

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Much of this program is similar to the
previous one; a file is opened and lines are read into <B>string</B> objects one
at a time. However, these <B>string</B> objects are pushed onto the back of the
<B>vector v</B>. Once the <B>while</B> loop completes, the entire file is
resident in memory, inside <B>v</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The next statement in the program is
called a
<A NAME="Index406"></A><A NAME="Index407"></A><A NAME="Index408"></A><B>for</B>
loop. It is similar to a <B>while</B> loop except that it adds some extra
control. After the <B>for</B>, there is a &#8220;<A NAME="Index409"></A>control
expression&#8221; inside of parentheses, just like the <B>while</B> loop.
However, this control expression is in three parts: a part which initializes,
one that tests to see if we should exit the loop, and one that changes
something, typically to step through a sequence of items. This program shows the
<B>for</B> loop in the way you&#8217;ll see it most commonly used: the
<A NAME="Index410"></A>initialization part <B>int i = 0</B> creates an integer
<B>i</B> to use as a loop counter and gives it an initial value of zero. The
testing portion says that to stay in the loop, <B>i</B> should be less than the
number of elements in the <B>vector v</B>. (This is produced using the member
function <B>size(&#160;),</B> which I just sort of slipped in here, but you must
admit it has a fairly obvious meaning.) The final portion uses a shorthand for C
and C++, the
&#8220;<A NAME="Index411"></A><A NAME="Index412"></A>auto-increment&#8221;
operator, to add one to the value of <B>i</B>. Effectively, <B>i++</B> says
&#8220;get the value of <B>i</B>, add one to it, and put the result back into
<B>i</B>. Thus, the total effect of the <B>for</B> loop is to take a variable
<B>i</B> and march it through the values from zero to one less than the size of
the <B>vector</B>. For each value of <B>i</B>, the <B>cout</B> statement is
executed and this builds a line that consists of the value of <B>i</B>
(magically converted to a character array by <B>cout</B>), a colon and a space,
the line from the file, and a newline provided by <B>endl</B>. When you compile
and run it you&#8217;ll see the effect is to add line numbers to the
file.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The intent of this chapter is to show you
how easy object-oriented programming can be &#8211; <I>if</I> someone else has
gone to the work of defining the objects for you. In that case, you include a
header file, create the objects, and send messages to them. If the types you are

and your resulting program will also be powerful.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In the process of showing the ease of OOP
when using library classes, this chapter also introduced some of the most basic
and useful types in the Standard C++ library: the family of iostreams (in
particular, those that read from and write to the console and files), the
<B>string</B> class, and the <B>vector</B> template. You&#8217;ve seen how
straightforward it is to use these and can now probably imagine many things you
can accomplish with them, but there&#8217;s actually a lot more that
they&#8217;re capable
of</FONT><A NAME="fnB29" HREF="#fn29">[29]</A><FONT FACE="Georgia">. Even though
we&#8217;ll only be using a limited subset of the functionality of these tools
in the early part of the book, they nonetheless provide a large step up from the
primitiveness of learning a low-level language like C. and while learning the
low-level aspects of C is educational, it&#8217;s also time consuming. In the
end, you&#8217;ll be much more productive if you&#8217;ve got objects to manage
the low-level issues. After all, the whole <I>point</I> of OOP is to hide the
details so you can &#8220;paint with a bigger brush.&#8221;</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
