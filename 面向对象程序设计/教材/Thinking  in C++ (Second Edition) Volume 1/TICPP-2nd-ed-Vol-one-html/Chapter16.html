<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although C++ templates are a
general-purpose programming tool, when they were introduced in the language,
they seemed to discourage the use of object-based container-class hierarchies
(demonstrated at the end of Chapter 15). For example, the Standard C++
containers and algorithms (explained in two chapters of Volume 2 of this book,
downloadable from <I>www.BruceEckel.com</I>) are built exclusively with
templates and are relatively easy for the programmer to use.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This chapter not only demonstrates the
basics of templates, it is also an introduction to containers, which are
fundamental components of object-oriented programming and are almost completely
realized through the containers in the Standard C++ Library. You&#8217;ll see
that this book has been using container examples &#8211; the <B>Stash </B>and
<B>Stack </B>&#8211; throughout, precisely to get you comfortable with
containers; in this chapter the concept of the <I>iterator</I> will also be
added. Although containers are ideal examples for use with templates, in Volume
2 (which has an advanced templates chapter) you&#8217;ll learn that there are
many other uses for templates as
well.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc305593275"></A><A NAME="_Toc305628747"></A><A NAME="_Toc312374063"></A><A NAME="_Toc472655047"></A><BR></P></DIV>

Fibonacci numbers to the array until the desired element is reached. But notice

The need for containers</H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Obviously, an integer stack isn&#8217;t a
crucial tool. The real need for containers comes when you start making objects
on the heap using <B>new</B> and destroying them with <B>delete</B>. In the
general programming problem, you don&#8217;t know how many objects you&#8217;re
going to need while you&#8217;re writing the program. For example, in an
air-traffic control system you don&#8217;t want to limit the number of planes
your system can handle. You don&#8217;t want the program to abort just because
you exceed some number. In a computer-aided design system, you&#8217;re dealing
with lots of shapes, but only the user determines (at runtime) exactly how many
shapes you&#8217;re going to need. Once you notice this tendency, you&#8217;ll
discover lots of examples in your own programming situations.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">C programmers who rely on virtual memory
to handle their &#8220;memory management&#8221; often find the idea of
<A NAME="Index2597"></A><A NAME="Index2598"></A><A NAME="Index2599"></A><B>new</B>,
<B>delete,</B> and container classes disturbing. Apparently, one practice in C
is to create a huge global array, larger than anything the program would appear
to need. This may not require much thought (or awareness of
<B>malloc(&#160;)</B> and <B>free(&#160;)</B>), but it produces programs that
don&#8217;t port well and that hide subtle bugs.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In addition, if you create a huge global
array of objects in C++, the constructor and destructor overhead can slow things
down significantly. The C++ approach works much better: When you need an object,
create it with <B>new,</B> and put its pointer in a container. Later on, fish it
out and do something to it. This way, you create only the objects you absolutely
need. And usually you don&#8217;t have all the initialization conditions
available at the start-up of the program. <B>new</B> allows you to wait until
something happens in the environment before you can actually create the
object.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">So in the most common situation,
you&#8217;ll make a container that holds pointers to some objects of interest.
You will create those objects using <B>new</B> and put the resulting pointer in
the container (potentially upcasting it in the process), pulling it out later
when you want to do something with the object. This technique produces the most
flexible, general sort of
program.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc305593276"></A><A NAME="_Toc305628748"></A><A NAME="_Toc312374065"></A><A NAME="_Toc472655049"></A><BR></P></DIV>

Overview of templates</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Now a problem arises. You have an
<B>IntStack</B>, which holds integers. But you want a stack that holds shapes or
aircraft or plants or something else. Reinventing your source code every time
doesn&#8217;t seem like a very intelligent approach with a language that touts
reusability. There must be a better way.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">There are three techniques for source
code reuse in this situation: the C way, presented here for contrast; the
Smalltalk approach, which significantly affected C++; and the C++ approach:
templates.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312374066"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>The C solution</B>. Of course
you&#8217;re trying to get away from the C approach because it&#8217;s messy and
error prone and completely inelegant. In this approach, you copy the source code
for a <B>Stack</B> and make modifications by hand, introducing new errors in the
process. This is certainly not a very productive
technique.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312374067"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>The Smalltalk solution</B>. Smalltalk
(and <A NAME="Index2600"></A>Java, following its example)
<A NAME="Index2601"></A>took a simple and straightforward approach: You want to
reuse code, so use inheritance.
<A NAME="Index2602"></A><A NAME="Index2603"></A><A NAME="Index2604"></A>To
implement this, each container class holds items of the generic base class
<B>Object</B> (similar to the example at the end of Chapter 15). But because the
library in Smalltalk is of such fundamental importance, you don&#8217;t ever
create a class from scratch. Instead, you must always inherit it from an
existing class. You find a class as close as possible to the one you want,
inherit from it, and make a few changes. Obviously, this is a benefit because it
minimizes your effort (and explains why you spend a lot of time learning the
class library before becoming an effective Smalltalk
programmer).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">But it also means that all classes in
Smalltalk end up being part of a single inheritance tree. You must inherit from
a branch of this tree when creating a new class. Most of the tree is already
there (it&#8217;s the Smalltalk class library), and at the root of the tree is a
class called <B>Object</B> &#8211; the same class that each Smalltalk container
holds.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This is a neat trick because it means
that every class in the Smalltalk (and
Java</FONT><A NAME="fnB59" HREF="#fn59">[59]</A><A NAME="Index2605"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">)
class hierarchy is derived from <B>Object</B>, so every class can be held in
every container (including that container itself). This type of single-tree
hierarchy based on a fundamental generic type (often named <B>Object</B>, which
is also the case in Java) is referred to as an &#8220;object-based
hierarchy.&#8221; You may have heard this term and assumed it was some new
fundamental concept in OOP, like polymorphism. It simply refers to a class
hierarchy with <B>Object</B> (or some similar name) at its root and container
classes that hold <B>Object</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because the Smalltalk class library had a
much longer history and experience behind it than did C++, and because the
original C++ compilers had <I>no</I> container class libraries, it seemed like a
good idea to duplicate the Smalltalk library in C++. This was done as an
experiment with an early C++
implementation</FONT><A NAME="fnB60" HREF="#fn60">[60]</A><A NAME="Index2606"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">,
and because it represented a significant body of code, many people began using
it. In the process of trying to use the container classes, they discovered a
problem.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The problem was that in Smalltalk (and
most other OOP languages that I know of), all classes are automatically derived
from a single hierarchy, but this isn&#8217;t true in C++. You might have your
nice object-based hierarchy with its container classes, but then you might buy a
set of shape classes or aircraft classes from another vendor who didn&#8217;t
use that hierarchy. (For one thing, using that hierarchy imposes overhead, which
C programmers eschew.) How do you insert a separate class tree into the
container class in your object-based hierarchy? Here&#8217;s what the problem
looks like:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Georgia"><IMG SRC="TIC2Vo21.gif"></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because C++ supports multiple independent
hierarchies, Smalltalk&#8217;s object-based hierarchy does not work so
well.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The solution seemed obvious. If you can
have many inheritance hierarchies, then you should be able to inherit from more
than one class: <A NAME="Index2607"></A><A NAME="Index2608"></A>Multiple
inheritance will solve the problem. So you do the following (a similar example
was given at the end of Chapter 15):</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Georgia"><IMG SRC="TIC2Vo22.gif"></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Now <B>OShape</B> has
<B>Shape</B>&#8217;s characteristics and behaviors, but because it is also
derived from <B>Object</B> it can be placed in <B>Container</B>. The extra
inheritance into <B>OCircle</B>, <B>OSquare</B>, etc. is necessary so that those
classes can be upcast into <B>OShape </B>and thus retain the correct behavior.
You can see that things are rapidly getting messy.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Compiler vendors invented and included
their own object-based container-class hierarchies, most of which have since
been replaced by template versions. You can argue that multiple inheritance is
needed for solving general programming problems, but you&#8217;ll see in Volume
2 of this book that its complexity is best avoided except in special
cases.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312374068"></A><A NAME="_Toc472655050"></A><BR></P></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading468"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
The template solution</H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although an object-based hierarchy with
multiple inheritance is conceptually straightforward, it turns out to be painful
to use. In his original
book</FONT><A NAME="fnB61" HREF="#fn61">[61]</A><A NAME="Index2609"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">
Stroustrup demonstrated what he considered a preferable alternative to the
object-based hierarchy. Container classes were created as large preprocessor
macros<A NAME="Index2610"></A><A NAME="Index2611"></A> with arguments that could
be substituted with your desired type. When you wanted to create a container to
hold a particular type, you made a couple of macro calls.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Unfortunately, this approach was confused
by all the existing Smalltalk literature and programming experience, and it was
a bit unwieldy. Basically, nobody got it.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In the meantime, Stroustrup and the C++
team at Bell Labs had modified his original macro approach, simplifying it and
moving it from the domain of the preprocessor into the compiler. This new
code-substitution device is called a
<A NAME="Index2612"></A><A NAME="Index2613"></A><B>template</B></FONT><A NAME="fnB62" HREF="#fn62">[62]</A><FONT FACE="Georgia">,
and it represents a completely different way to reuse code. Instead of reusing
object code, as with inheritance and composition, a template reuses <I>source
code<A NAME="Index2614"></A></I>. The container no longer holds a generic base
class called <B>Object</B>, but instead it holds an unspecified parameter. When
you use a template, the parameter is substituted <I>by the compiler</I>, much
like the old macro approach, but cleaner and easier to use.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Now, instead of worrying about
inheritance or composition when you want to use a container class, you take the
template version of the container and stamp out a specific version for your
particular problem, like this:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Georgia"><IMG SRC="TIC2Vo23.gif"></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The compiler does the work for you, and
you end up with exactly the container you need to do your job, rather than an
unwieldy inheritance hierarchy. In C++, the template implements the concept of a
<I>parameterized type</I>. Another benefit of the template approach is that the
novice programmer who may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with inheritance can
still use canned container classes right away (as we&#8217;ve been doing with
<B>vector</B> throughout the
book).</FONT><A NAME="_Toc305593277"></A><A NAME="_Toc305628749"></A><A NAME="_Toc312374069"></A><A NAME="_Toc472655051"></A><BR></P></DIV>

template definitions are special. Anything preceded by

everything you can to protect it, and probably you don&#8217;t want to give
source code, just compiled code. But many people see software as a service, and

Turning ownership on and off</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Let&#8217;s return to the ownership
problem<A NAME="Index2676"></A><A NAME="Index2677"></A>. Containers that hold
objects by value don&#8217;t usually worry about ownership because they clearly
own the objects they contain. But if your container holds pointers (which is
more common with C++, especially with <A NAME="Index2678"></A>polymorphism),
then it&#8217;s very likely those pointers may also be used somewhere else in
the program, and you don&#8217;t necessarily want to delete the object because
then the other pointers in the program would be referencing a destroyed object.
To prevent this from happening, you must consider ownership when designing and
using a container.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Many programs are much simpler than this,
and don&#8217;t encounter the ownership problem: One container holds pointers to
objects that are used only by that container. In this case ownership is very
straightforward: The container owns its objects.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The best approach to handling the
ownership problem is to give the client programmer a choice. This is often
accomplished by a constructor argument that defaults to indicating ownership
(the simplest case). In addition there may be &#8220;get&#8221; and
&#8220;set&#8221; functions to view and modify the ownership of the container.
If the container has functions to remove an object, the ownership state usually
affects that removal, so you may also find options to control destruction in the
removal function. You could conceivably add ownership data for every element in
the container, so each position would know whether it needed to be destroyed;
this is a variant of reference counting, <A NAME="Index2679"></A> except that
the container and not the object knows the number of references pointing to an
object.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">An <I>iterator</I> is an object that
moves through a container of other objects and selects them one at a time,
without providing direct access to the implementation of that container.
Iterators provide a standard way to access elements, whether or not a container
provides a way to access the elements directly. You will see iterators used most
often in association with container classes, and iterators are a fundamental
concept in the design and use of the Standard C++ containers, which are fully
described in Volume 2 of this book (downloadable from
<I>www.BruceEckel.com</I>). An iterator is also a kind of
<A NAME="Index2683"></A><A NAME="Index2684"></A><I>design pattern</I>, which is

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Like a pointer,
<B>IntStackIter</B>&#8217;s job is to move through an <B>IntStack</B> and
retrieve values. In this simple example, the <B>IntStackIter</B> can move only
forward (using both the pre- and postfix forms of the <B>operator++</B>).
However, there is no boundary to the way an iterator can be defined, other than
those imposed by the constraints of the container it works with. It is perfectly
acceptable (within the limits of the underlying container) for an iterator to
move around in any way within its associated container and to cause the
contained values to be modified.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">It is customary that an iterator is
created with a constructor that attaches it to a single container object, and
that the iterator is not attached to a different container during its lifetime.
(Iterators are usually small and cheap, so you can easily make another
one.)</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">With the iterator, you can traverse the
elements of the stack without popping them, just as a pointer can move through
the elements of an array. However, the iterator knows the underlying structure
of the stack and how to traverse the elements, so even though you are moving
through them by pretending to &#8220;increment a pointer,&#8221; what&#8217;s
going on underneath is more involved. That&#8217;s the key to the iterator: It
is abstracting the complicated process of moving from one container element to
the next into something that looks like a pointer. The goal is for <I>every</I>
iterator in your program to have the same interface so that any code that uses
the iterator doesn&#8217;t care what it&#8217;s pointing to &#8211; it just
knows that it can reposition all iterators the same way, so the container that
the iterator points to is unimportant. In this way you can write more generic
code. All of the containers and algorithms in the Standard C++ Library are based
on this principle of iterators.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">To aid in making things more generic, it
would be nice to be able to say &#8220;every container has an associated class

The solution is to add a <A NAME="Index2685"></A><A NAME="Index2686"></A>nested
<B>iterator</B> class to each container (notice that in this case,
&#8220;<B>iterator</B>&#8221; begins with a lowercase letter so that it conforms

first use of the iterator just marches it from beginning to end (and shows that
the end sentinel works properly). In the second usage, you can see how iterators
allow you to easily specify a range of elements (the containers and iterators in
the Standard C++ Library use this concept of ranges almost everywhere). The
overloaded <B>operator+=</B> moves the <B>start</B> and <B>end</B> iterators to
positions in the middle of the range of the elements in <B>is</B>, and these
elements are printed out. Notice in the output that the end sentinel is
<I>not</I> included in the range, thus it can be one past the end of the range
to let you know you&#8217;ve passed the end &#8211; but you don&#8217;t
dereference the end sentinel, or else you can end up dereferencing a null
pointer. (I&#8217;ve put guarding in the <B>StackTemplate::iterator</B>, but in

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><A NAME="Index2697"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">You&#8217;ll also
notice the class has been changed to support ownership, which works now because
the class knows the exact type (or at least the base type, which will work
assuming virtual destructors are used). The default is for the container to
destroy its objects but you are responsible for any pointers that you
<B>pop(&#160;)</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><A NAME="Index2698"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">The iterator is
simple, and physically very small &#8211; the size of a single pointer. When you
create an <B>iterator</B>, it&#8217;s initialized to the head of the linked
list, and you can only increment it forward through the list. If you want to
start over at the beginning, you create a new iterator, and if you want to
remember a spot in the list, you create a new iterator from the existing
iterator pointing at that spot (using the iterator&#8217;s
copy-constructor<A NAME="Index2699"></A>).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">To call functions for the object referred
to by the iterator, you can use the <B>current(&#160;)</B> function, the

pointer dereference
<B>operator-&gt;<A NAME="Index2702"></A><A NAME="Index2703"></A></B> (a common
sight in iterators). The latter has an implementation that <I>looks</I>
identical to <B>current(&#160;)</B> because it returns a pointer to the current
object, but is different because the pointer dereference operator performs the
extra levels of dereferencing (see Chapter 12).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The <B>iterator</B> class follows the
form you saw in the prior example. <B>class iterator</B> is nested inside the
container class, it contains constructors to create both an iterator pointing at
an element in the container and an &#8220;end sentinel&#8221; iterator, and the
container class has the <B>begin(&#160;)</B> and <B>end(&#160;)</B> methods to
produce these iterators. (When you learn the more about the Standard C++
Library, you&#8217;ll see that the names <B>iterator</B>, <B>begin(&#160;)</B>,
and <B>end(&#160;)</B> that are used here were clearly lifted standard container

references to the current iterator, which is the more typical and flexible
approach to take.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The destructor calls <B>delete </B>for

<B>virtual</B> destructor<A NAME="Index2706"></A><A NAME="Index2707"></A> to
ensure proper cleanup of derived objects whose addresses have been upcast when

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The <B>PStash::iterator</B> follows the
iterator model of bonding to a single container object for its lifetime. In
addition, the copy-constructor allows you to make a new iterator pointing at the

making a bookmark into the container. The <B>operator+=</B> and
<B>operator-=</B> member functions allow you to move an iterator by a number of
spots, while respecting the boundaries of the container. The overloaded
increment and decrement operators move the iterator by one place. The
<B>operator+ </B>produces a new iterator that&#8217;s moved forward by the
amount of the addend. As in the previous example, the pointer dereference
operators are used to operate on the element the iterator is referring to, and

specification of one or more types. You just want to say that these type
parameters support certain operations, not exactly what types they
are.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><A NAME="Index2727"></A><A NAME="Index2728"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia">The
function template <B>drawAll(&#160;)</B> can be thought of as an
<I>algorithm</I> (and this is what most of the function templates in the
Standard C++ Library are called). It just says how to do something given
iterators describing a range of elements, as long as these iterators can be
dereferenced, incremented, and compared. These are exactly the kind of iterators
we have been developing in this chapter, and also &#8211; not coincidentally
&#8211; the kind of iterators that are produced by the containers in the
Standard C++ Library, evidenced by the use of <B>vector</B> in this example.
</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">We&#8217;d also like
<B>drawAll(&#160;)</B> to be a <A NAME="Index2729"></A><I>generic algorithm</I>,
so that the containers can be any type at all and we don&#8217;t have to write a
new version of the algorithm for each different type of container. Here&#8217;s
where function templates are essential, because they automatically generate the
specific code for each different type of container. But without the extra
indirection provided by the iterators, this genericness wouldn&#8217;t be
possible. That&#8217;s why iterators are important; they allow you to write
general-purpose code that involves containers without knowing the underlying
structure of the container. (Notice that, in C++, iterators and generic
algorithms require function templates in order to work.)</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You can see the proof of this in
<B>main(&#160;)</B>, since <B>drawAll(&#160;)</B> works unchanged with each
different type of container. And even more interesting, <B>drawAll(&#160;)</B>
also works with pointers to the beginning and end of the array <B>sarray</B>.
This ability to treat arrays as containers is integral to the design of the
Standard C++ Library, whose algorithms look much like
<B>drawAll(&#160;)</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because container class
templates<A NAME="Index2730"></A><A NAME="Index2731"></A><A NAME="Index2732"></A>
are rarely subject to the inheritance and upcasting you see with

Summary</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Container classes are an essential part
of object-oriented programming. They are another way to simplify and hide the
details of a program and to speed the process of program development. In
addition, they provide a great deal of safety and flexibility by replacing the
primitive arrays and relatively crude data structure techniques found in
C.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because the client programmer needs
containers, it&#8217;s essential that they be easy to use. This is where the
<B>template</B> comes in. With templates the syntax for source-code reuse (as
opposed to object-code reuse provided by inheritance and composition) becomes
trivial enough for the novice user. In fact, reusing code with templates is
notably easier than inheritance and composition.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although you&#8217;ve learned about
creating container and iterator classes in this book, in practice it&#8217;s
much more expedient to learn the containers and iterators in the Standard C++
Library, since you can expect them to be available with every compiler. As you
will see in Volume 2 of this book (downloadable from <I>www.BruceEckel.com</I>),
the containers and algorithms in the Standard C++ Library will virtually always
fulfill your needs so you don&#8217;t have to create new ones
yourself.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The issues involved with container-class
design have been touched upon in this chapter, but you may have gathered that
they can go much further. A complicated container-class library may cover all
sorts of additional issues, including multithreading, persistence and garbage
collection.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312374095"></A><A NAME="_Toc472655065"></A><BR></P></DIV>
