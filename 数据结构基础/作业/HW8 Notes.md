### 1-1 in a connected graph, the number of edges must be greater than the number of vertices minus 1.

equal or greater

### 1-2 In a directed graph, the sum of the in-degrees must be equal to the sum of the out-degrees of all the vertices.

an edge must have exactly one src and one dest

### 1-3 If a directed graph G=(V, E) is weakly connected, then there must be at least |V| edges in G.

at least |V-1| in G, same as 1-1

### 2-1 If graph G is NOT connected and has 35 edges, then it must have at least ____ vertices.

if a graph is not connected, it can have at most, the rest n-1 verticies are all connected,  C(n-1,2) edges.

n-1*n-2/2>35, n=10

### 2-2 A graph with 90 vertices and 20 edges must have at least __ connected component(s).

90-70

R(region) = V-E+C(Component+1

### 2-3

### 2-4 Given an undirected graph G with 16 edges, where 3 vertices are of degree 4, 4 vertices are of degree 3, and all the other vertices are of degrees less than 3. Then G must have at least __ vertices.

16\*2 = 4\*3+3*4+2x

x=4

x+3+4 = 11
