 
The first priority*** - to finish all homework by yourself, including small tasks maybe not in written, such as saying meta-characters in English, running demonstration programs and etc.

作业文档在最晚在(01/29)交到学在浙大，但建议在考试前要完成所有作业中的实验，这样对考试内容更有把握。

教师作业检查和答疑时间：现暂定01/25下午，老生仪楼606室，看是否和同学课程时间冲突。看情况决定是否另外再安排一次。答疑只解答同学复习时遇到的具体问题哦，考试的内容不涉及。但考试的英文题目必须要和作业题目一样读懂，精确理解后再回答。
