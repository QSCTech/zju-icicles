Please CAREFULLY read the questions and follow instructions to answer.

Problem 0. Briefly and clearly report what you have done for Homework Assignment #4.

Problem 1. Build 'demo_fork.c' and run it, then try to change the red eyes to 'browse.tcl' and run it again.
 Invoke more directory browsers from browse.tcl. Use 'pstree' to see the process hierarchy for all of them, 
and show the hierarchy with a screenshot.se'r

Problem 2. Run Python scripts of demo_8queen.py and demo_showqueens.py,
 read the source code, comments and their outputs.


 Then (OPTIONALLY) write a Perl or Python script to analyze the solutions in 8queen.out,
 and show how many kinds of the solutions are unique.
 (symmetrical solutions are not considered as unique, for example, one solution being mirrored or rotated
 should be eliminated from the unique list)
