Then after watching all 3 episodes of Triumph of Nerds, try to answer questions below.
1) Where does Gordon Moore sit and what does he say in the video? (Triumph of Nerds)
2) What is Xerox PARC? Steve Jobs has mentioned 3 innovations from it, what are the other two besides GUI? (Triumph of Nerds)
3) What is the opinion of Steve Jobs towards Bill Gates? (Triumph of Nerds)


Then let's try working on our installed system.

Problem 1.
Try to run *cat /etc/passwd* in your shell, and read the result, each line of which is composed of some words separated by ':'.
Then please read the manuals of UNIX utilities "cut" and "paste" (e.g., man cut; info paste), and understand how to use them. 
Our target is to cut the 1st word (i.e., field 1 - the user names) and the 6th word (i.e., field 6 - HOME directories) in each line from file /etc/passwd, and store them in 2 separated new files.
 
Then we paste the 2 files together into a new file with only 2 word columns, and these 2 columns are separated by one tab character in each line.
The expected result looks like,
root	/root
daemon	/usr/sbin
bin	/bin
sys	/dev
sync	/bin
games	/usr/games
man	/var/cache/man
lp	/var/spool/lpd
mail	/var/mail
news	/var/spool/news
landscape	/var/lib/landscape
postgres	/var/lib/postgresql
uucp	/var/spool/uucp

Problem 2.
Please read the manual of UNIX utility "expand", and change the tab character in the result of Problem 2 into many space characters, while the word alignment keeps and the 2nd word always begins on the 24th column.
The expected result looks like,
root                   /root
daemon                 /usr/sbin
bin                    /bin
sys                    /dev
sync                   /bin
games                  /usr/games
man                    /var/cache/man
lp                     /var/spool/lpd
mail                   /var/mail
news                   /var/spool/news
landscape              /var/lib/landscape
postgres               /var/lib/postgresql
uucp                   /var/spool/uucp

Problem 3.
Everything similar as in Problem 1, but try to show the results in a manner like below.
root:
/root
daemon:
/usr/sbin
bin:
/bin
sys:
/dev
sync:
/bin
games:
/usr/games
man:
/var/cache/man
lp:
/var/spool/lpd
mail:
/var/mail
news:
/var/spool/news
landscape:
/var/lib/landscape
postgres:
/var/lib/postgresql
uucp:
/var/spool/uucp

The purpose of these problems 1/2/3 is to let the students do manual reading, understand meaning of options and practice a little on text processing.
