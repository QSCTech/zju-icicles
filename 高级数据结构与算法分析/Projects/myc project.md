Consider the following strip packing problem.

Input: you are given *n* rectangles, each having a width and a height. You are also given a bin with a given width. The height of bin can be as large as you want. (You may assume that the width of any rectangle is no more than the width of the bin.)

Output: you are required to packing the rectangle into the bin so that the height of the bin is minimized. Note that you are not allowed to rotate the rectangles, and that the rectangles should not overlap.

For more information, please refer to Wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_packing_problem)).

This project requires you to implement at least two polynomial-time approximation algorithms for this problem. You must generate test cases of different sizes (from 10 to 10,000) with different distributions of widths and heights, and compare the solution quality and the running time of the two algorithms on these test cases. A thorough analysis on all the factors that might affect the approximation ratio of your proposed algorithm is expected.
